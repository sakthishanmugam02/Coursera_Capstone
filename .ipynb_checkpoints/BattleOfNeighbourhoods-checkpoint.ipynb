    "#### Background\n",
    "One fine day, one of my close friends came to me and said, he had won the lottery ticket and would like to spend half of the money to charity and with the remaining amount he would like to invest in a clothing shop in New York. I congratulated him and encouraged his idea of opening the shop and suggested him to go ahead. Then our discussion went further on exploring different categories of clothing shops (such as Women's, Men's and Kids). Suddenly we started puzzling about how many shops are there in each category and what are the people's interests? and so on. We don't have any clue at all of these facts. But we realized one thing that all these data are very much important. "

    "Time was ticking and we had no clue on how to collect these data and solve the problem, then we decided to call our friend (Ankur) who was working as a Data Analyst. We explained the full details. He replied that he could help us by analyzing the data available on the Internet and also he ensured he would come up with the required information in a presentable format so that we could also understand his analysis in a simple manner.
